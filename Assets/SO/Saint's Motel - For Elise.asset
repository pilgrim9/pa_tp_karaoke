  fullLyrics: 'When it''s tough

    When you get stuck

    You''re at the wall

    Of
    the writer''s block

    You need a spark

    A light in the dark

    To get
    you out of your head

    And into your heart

    Taking a walk on the wild
    side

    Something in the way she moves

    Candle in the wind

    And it''s
    blowing everywhere we go

    All these girls got something going on

    Met
    in the club her name was Lola

    Champagne tasting Coca-Cola

    In the hands
    of my loving

    My love does her good

    All us boys need something, that
    they got

    This one''s for Elise

    Norma Jean, Pattie Boyd and Carole King

    Holly
    Woodlawn, Linda Eastman

    Candy Darling got it started with a song

    This
    one''s for Elise

    The muses of the Greeks and Romans

    Steal the immortal
    beloved of Beethoven

    They all lit a spark and you know that they got it
    going

    Shout out to the girl, over there, in my chair:

    Whoa Elise, Norma
    Jean

    Pattie Boyd and Carole King

    Holly Woodlawn, Linda Eastman, Candy
    Darling got it started with a song

    This one''s for Elise

    This one''s
    for Elise, Norma Jean, Pattie Boyd and Carole King

    Holly Woodlawn, Linda
    Eastman, Candy Darling got it started

    For Elise, Norma Jean, Pattie Boyd
    and Carole King

    Holly Woodlawn, Linda Eastman, Candy Darling got it started
    with a song

    This one''s for Elise'
